#Integer Pointers in C++
Overview
This repository contains a simple C++ program demonstrating dynamic memory allocation using pointers. The program prompts the user to enter three integer values, stores them in variables, and dynamically allocates memory for each value using pointers. It then displays both the stored values and the dereferenced pointer values before properly deallocating memory.

Features
Accepts three integer inputs from the user.

Uses dynamic memory allocation (new) to store values in the heap.

Displays both original variables and pointer values.

Safely deallocates memory (delete) to prevent leaks.

Implements best practices for pointer usage, including setting pointers to nullptr after deletion.
